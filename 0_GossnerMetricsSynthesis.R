###BODY SIZE
# Body size was defined as the mean body length in mm over males and females. We standardized available information within 
# one taxon by using information given in one standard compilation, i.e., Freude et al.20 for Coleoptera, Biedermann and 
# Niedringhaus27 for Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha, Wachmann et al.29 for Hemiptera: Heteroptera, and the spiders of Europe 
# website50 for Araneae. In Orthoptera, sizes were averaged across values given in different sources52–54.

####DISPERSAL
# Dispersal ability, ranging from 0 to 1 by steps of 0.25, was defined differently for the groups, depending on available information.
# For Hemiptera and most Coleoptera, wing dimorphism between males and females was used, assigning 1 for species with fully developed 
# wings in both sexes; 0.75 for predominantly macropterous species; 0.5 for equally brachypterous and macropterous species; 
# 0.25 for predominantly brachypterous species and 0 for always brachypterous species. For other Coleoptera, dispersal ability was 
# based on descriptions of flying ability20,26. Species of Araneae were assigned to the five dispersal groups taking into account 
# activity ranges and dispersal strategies (e.g., ballooning and migration), given in different sources41–48. 
# Species which are known to be very frequent ‘aeronauts’ and which are observed very frequently outside their main habitat were assigned 1.
# In contrast, class 0 would include species which never show ballooning behavior, but this did not apply to any sampled species. 
# Species which show ballooning only over a few meter distance and were never observed outside their main habitat were assigned 0.25. 
# When species observations outside the main habitat have been observed more frequently, species were assigned to 0.5 or 0.75 depending 
# on the relative frequency of these observations. For Orthoptera, active dispersal ability is estimated on the basis of the size of 
# the hind wings (alae), the occurrence of macropterous forms and studies of individual movement and colonization dynamics. 
# We followed the classification of Reinhardt et al.59 for this trait, which takes these three criteria into account.
# It is largely based on the (a) wing development of the adults57, complemented by (b) results from population studies
# on individual movements reviewed in55,56 and long-term observations of local and regional colonization dynamics reviewed in55,56.
# Additionally, (c) passive dispersal behavior, e.g., by eggs attached to stipes and spread by flooding was considered51,52.
# All flightless species were assigned very low (0) dispersal ability and low (0.25) dispersal ability if they were using passive 
# dispersal behavior. The other species which are able to fly were assigned to the higher dispersal abilities depending on their 
# dispersal behavior considering criteria (b); minor individual movements and colonization dynamics was assigned medium (0.5) 
# dispersal ability, average individual movements and colonization dynamics was assigned high (0.75) dispersal ability and 
# high individual movements and colonization dynamics was assigned very high (1) dispersal ability.

###FEEDING SPECIALIZATION
# Feeding specialization was defined as host plant niche breadth of herbivores based on the main higher plant lineages60. 
# We classified (m)onophages as species feeding on one plant genus, 
# (o)ligophages as species feeding on one higher plant lineage (i.e., bryophytes, ferns, gymnosperms, angiosperms: monocots, 
# angiosperms: basal eudicots, angiosperms: eurosids, angiosperms: euasterids), 
# and (p)olyphages as species feeding on more than one higher plant lineage. Generally, the classification is based on larval 
# stages. Exceptions are Coleoptera species that develop in dead wood, but feed on plant pollen as adults, in which the 
# specialization of adults was used. Classification is based on Böhme23,24, Koch61 and Rheinheimer & Hassler26 for 
# herbivorous Coleoptera, Nickel28 for Auchenorrhyncha, Wachmann et al.29 for herbivorous Heteroptera, and Baur et al.53,
# Detzel58, Ingrisch & Köhler55, and Maas et al.52 for herbivorous Orthoptera.

# in the Heteroptera families Miridae, Pentatomidae and Rhopalidae and on hard lipid-rich ripe seeds on the 
# ground, which is common in the Heteroptera family Lygaeidae. Classification is based on Nickel28 for Auchenorrhyncha

###STRATUM USE
# Vertical stratum use was selected as a trait of habitat preference and defined as the main vegetation layer (stratum) 
# in which the species is usually observed as juvenile and adult. A coarser as well as a finer classification is given. 
# We distinguished between soil-dwelling, ground-dwelling, herb-, shrub and/or tree-layer species, and species linked to water bodies.
# In the finer classification all strata which a particular species uses as habitat are given, with less frequent assignments given 
# in brackets. In the coarser classification, all species that use more than one stratum during their life cycle were categorized as
# unspecific, thus ignoring different larval and adult habitat niches. For example, several Coleoptera of the family Curculionidae 
# (e.g., genera Otiorhynchus, Phyllobius, Sitona) feed on plant roots in the soil in their larval phase but on leaves in the herb 
# layer as adults26. Those species were hence assigned as unspecific in the coarse classification and as soil-and herb-layer species
# in the finer classification. Where specific information was missing (several Auchenorrhyncha & Coleoptera), the stratum was assigned 
# from the main feeding source or the association with certain plant species. Where information on the species level was missing, 
# information on genera or family level was used, provided that the trait value of the higher taxonomic unit was assumed to be equal
# for all species based on information given in literature or based on authors’ experience. Classification is based on Platen49 and 
# Platen et al.32,36, and adapted with information in Maurer & Hänggi31, Malten33,34, Malten & Blick35, Blick38,39 and the expert’s 
# experience for Araneae; on Böhme24, Freude et al.20, Homburg et al.14, and Rheinheimer and Hassler26 for Coleoptera; on Nickel28 for 
# Auchenorrhyncha; on Wachmann et al.29 for Heteroptera, and on Köhler51, Baur et al.53, and Maas et al.52 for Orthoptera.
